# Tabelline Voice App (originally built for Anna) 💛

This project began as something I wanted to create for my daughter **Anna**, who is now learning the multiplication tables.  
It’s designed to be playful, interactive, and encouraging — the kind of experience that makes children want to keep practicing.

**I built this for Anna, but it’s free and ready for any child who’s just starting their multiplication adventure.**

## 👨‍👧 Why it was created
Because children learn best when they feel safe, supported, and interested —  
and because tools made with intention and love often work better than generic apps.

This project began for Anna, but now it’s a small learning tool meant for **any child beginning their journey with multiplication.**
