# tabelline-voice-app-for-anna
Voice-enabled multiplication tables app for kids (7–8 years old), originally built for my daughter Anna.

# Tabelline Voice App (originally built for Anna) 💛

This project began as something I wanted to create for my daughter **Anna**, who is now learning the multiplication tables.  
The app is designed to be playful, interactive, and encouraging — the kind of experience that makes children want to keep practicing.

While it started as a personal tool for Anna, it is now written in a way that can help **any 7–8 year old** who is learning multiplication and benefits from a friendly, voice-based, game-like experience.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Make learning multiplication feel natural and fun  
- Support children aged **7–8** (or anyone starting with 1–9 tables)  
- Reduce pressure and encourage repeated practice  
- Use voice, visuals, and rewards to keep them engaged  
- Provide a simple tool that works on any browser or device

---

## ✨ Features
- Voice questions in **Spanish**, **Italian**, or **English**  
- Randomised exercises from the **1–9 tables**  
  - Tables 1–2 appear less often  
  - Tables 3–9 appear with equal probability  
- Score tracking and accuracy display  
- Timer modes (2 / 3 / 5 minutes or no timer)  
- Encouraging feedback messages  
- Works on iPad, iPhone, Mac, Windows, and Android

## 🌟 Upcoming improvements
Designed to make learning even more playful:

- Cute icons (stars, stickers, characters)  
- Fun animations for correct answers (confetti, star bursts)  
- A dedicated kid-friendly theme with larger buttons  
- A motivating “Great job!” voice mode  
- Optional rewards (badges, points, stars)  
- Offline mode for travel or limited connectivity

## 👨‍👧 Why it was created
Because children learn best when they feel safe, supported, and interested —  
and because tools made with intention and love often work better than generic apps.

This project began for Anna, but it is now a small learning tool meant for **any child beginning their journey with multiplication**.
